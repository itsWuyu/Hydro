Hydroponic System

Just some code for my DIY Hydroponic System.

There will be 2 folders

1. Folder :
 - Safety system for the waterpump

2. Folder : 
  - Code for the sensors and the main system

Feel free to use it :)

TODO : 
 - Check Sensor values via Telegram
 - Webscraper to get data from hidden page and store it into a database
 - Clean up Code
 - include MH-Z19B
